Project Tetris - Part 4

Assignment Overview:

The purpose of milestone 4 was to get us to think outside of the box with our games. We were to clean it up and make
any extra features we decide to gut in. In mine specifically, I usd sound, lots of animations, a nice background for 
game board, and a unique picture for each block falling.

Technical Impression:

I love the outcome of this project. Very VERY satisfying to say the least. Although it was a rough project for me to 
begin with, I am so happy with how it turned out. I didn't get to implement all of the features I wanted just for the
sole reason of me NEEDING the extra extension from this assignment. I plan to use this extra extension for assignment
number 2 by the way. I do, however, plan to keep working on this game to get it completely polished (or at least as 
polished as 8-bit graphics can get haha) just for the simple fact that I think its really cool and am astonished/proud
of what I was able to build. At the beginning of the quarter, I would have had absolutely no idea how to do anything even
close to this. Just so you know, I eventually want to make this into a two player game and have there be two characters
from the megaman universe (by users choice). These two characters will be in the middle of the two games and will "battle"
each other. The more lines the person clears, the lower the health bar on the opponents character will go. When one of the
characters health bars reaches zero, that means that they are the LOSER. I think it would be fun to try and implement, and 
will definitely send you a copy of it once I do! I hope you enjoy my 8-bit throwback as much as I enjoyed creating it!
