Assignment Overview:

The purpose of this assignment was to build a board class to compliment the pieces class that
we built in part 1 of the assignment. The board class is supposed to be able to put pieces on 
it, remove pieces from it, check bounds for pieces so that they cant go out of the board, move
pieces left right and down, detect full lines, detect multiple full lines, and erase full lines 
while moving ones above it down one line.

Technical Impression:

This class was easier for me to create than the pieces were for some reason. It made more sense
since I already had the pieces created. I did some major changes to my piece class though, because
I was originally doing bounds checking with the pieces, not the board. I also had move left right and 
down in the pieces class. Those are all moved to the board class now. I also renovated my board class 
to get rid of the Component inner class that I had originally had. I still however don't understand the 
JUnit testing all that much. I tried looking for help and getting help from the CSS mentors, but I still
just don't get it. It still seems, to me at least, that it would be more beneficial time wise, to just 
write out a Gui class to test the board and the pieces. Again, that's just my opinion. I was able to figure
out how to test the constructor in the board class though.
