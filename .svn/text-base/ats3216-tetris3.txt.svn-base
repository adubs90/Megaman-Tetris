Assignment Overview:

The purpose of milestone 4 was to get us to think outside of the box with our games. We were to clean it up and make 
it look like a fun to play game.

Technical Impression:

So this one gave me trouble. Not in the programming necessarily (although there were some hiccups) but mainly
because of eclipse and Java itself... I kept getting an error message whenever I tried to open eclipse, which 
was maddening to say the least. I can run it when i use administrator access, but even then, eclipse will randomly
pop up errors and force close... Very frustrating. I tested my code on another computer, so I believe that It SHOULD
work, but if not, please let me know. This started occurring out of nowhere, but before it happened, my program was
working correctly. Anyways, those difficulties aside, this is a basic gui. For my final version, I want to theme my 
game off of quite possibly my favorite video game hero, Megaman. You will probably see some commented out sections in 
my game logic and in my gui, as these are ideas of things I want to implement for the final version, but didn't want to
forget how to implement them. Also, as you'll see, I decided to use a simple thread to run my actual game. I did some 
extra research on threads and thought i would challenge myself into using one. It actually turned out to be fairly simple,
to my great surprise.
